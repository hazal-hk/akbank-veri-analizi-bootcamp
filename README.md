Abstract
This report delves into the analysis of income distribution among individuals with a focus on various demographic factors. Through a series of analyses, including general income distribution, income distribution by age groups, education levels, marital status, race, and occupation, we aimed to understand the intricate relationship between these demographic variables and income levels.
Our findings reveal that demographic factors such as education, age, marital status, race, and occupation significantly influence income levels. Generally, higher education and certain age groups tend to correlate with higher income levels. Additionally, factors such as marital status, race, and occupation play a discernible role in income distribution.
These insights underscore the importance of inclusive education policies and equitable economic opportunities. They provide valuable guidance for policymakers aiming to formulate fairer and more inclusive policies. Moreover, they highlight the necessity for further research and policy interventions to comprehensively understand and address the impact of demographic factors on income distribution.
